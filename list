TLB
Low latency associative memory that stores memory address mappings.

Level 1 cache
High-speed volatile storage that stores copies of memory stored in DRAM.

Segment
A variable-sized unit of process memory (base and bound are variable) generally used to organize memory usage.

page
A fixed-sized unit of process memory (base is variable, bound is fixed to one of a small number of values).

lock
A mechanism for providing exclusive access to a shared resource.

concurrency
When multiple computations run at the same time and can interact with each other.

mutual exclusion
The property of only allowing a single computation access to a set of code at any given time, even though multiple computations may attempt to run that code at the same time.

atomic operation
A small computation that cannot be interrupted.

race condition
When a concurrent computation produces different results because of differing rates of execution.

memory hierarchy
A design principle/conceptual model of computer architecture in which information moves between large pools of persistent but slow storage to smaller, faster memory stores.

virtual address
The memory addresses that are used by processes.

physical address
The memory addresses that refer to actual memory locations in RAM.

latency
The time between a request and that request being fulfilled.

bandwidth
The rate of data transfer.

mmap
A system call for mapping byte ranges in a file to byte ranges in a process's address space.

locality of reference
Programs tend to exhibit patterns in their code and data memory accesses. Nearby memory is accessed more frequently than distant memory, and memory accessed in the past is often accessed again in the future.

page table entry
The upper bits of a physical address along with metadata bits. It is cached in the TLB.

page table
The data structure that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.
